# Testing JS Module Evaluation in Webpack

This project is designed to test the evaluation of JavaScript modules in Webpack. The code in this repository includes a function or code block that can be used to test the evaluation of modules in Webpack.

As the design of Module in ES6, [A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported](https://javascript.info/modules-intro#a-module-code-is-evaluated-only-the-first-time-when-imported)

My concern is about is it work the same way in the context of webpack bundler
